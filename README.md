# Bridge-MP-HW
Homework For CUNY Math Python Bridge Class
I started using Python 3.2 on my laptop. I saw how colab linked with github and put all the code into colb. When I go to the homework 4 asignment I saw that I needed to switch to a version of python that had SYMPY.
I tried pycharm and switch to jumpyter and completed homework 4 and 5. I have not found a way to send from jumpyter to github, so I copied the code and put it in colab.

Due to not getting a chance to start soon enough, when I finish the SQL asignment I will go back to the next and last homework 01 pyython assignments.
